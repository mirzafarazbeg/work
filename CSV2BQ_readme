 1. MySQL Data Source:
   - The workflow starts with a MySQL database, which stores the data that needs to be processed and analyzed.

 2. Scheduler:
   - A scheduler (likely Google Cloud Scheduler) is used to trigger events or tasks at specific intervals. In this case:
     - It fetches data from MySQL.
     - Passes the data to the next stage of the pipeline.

 3. Cloud Functions:
   - Google Cloud Functions are used as event-driven components. They process data after the scheduler triggers them. Here, the Cloud Function:
     - Extracts data from MySQL.
     - Converts or prepares the data into a suitable format (e.g., CSV).

 4. CSV File to Cloud Storage:
   - The processed data is saved as a CSV file and uploaded to Google Cloud Storage.

 5. Folder Watcher Cloud Function:
   - Another Cloud Function, acting as a folder watcher, monitors the Cloud Storage bucket.
     - When a new CSV file is uploaded, it triggers the next part of the pipeline.

 6. Dataflow Pipeline:
   - The Google Cloud Dataflow service is used to process and transform the data.
     - It reads the CSV file from Cloud Storage.
     - Performs any required transformations, aggregations, or calculations.
     - Writes the final, processed data to BigQuery.

 7. BigQuery Table:
   - The transformed data is loaded into a BigQuery table, making it ready for querying and analysis.

 8. Cloud Function to SendGrid:
   - A final Cloud Function is triggered once the data is available in BigQuery.
     - It generates a notification or report (e.g., based on data in BigQuery).
     - Sends an email using SendGrid, an email delivery service, to notify stakeholders or provide processed data.

 Key Components:
   - MySQL: Data source.
   - Cloud Scheduler: Task automation.
   - Cloud Functions: Event-driven logic at different stages.
   - Cloud Storage: Intermediate storage for CSV files.
   - Dataflow: Data processing and transformation.
   - BigQuery: Data warehouse for analytics.
   - SendGrid: Email delivery for notifications.

 Overall Flow:
1. Data from MySQL is scheduled to be fetched.
2. Data is converted to CSV and stored in Cloud Storage.
3. Folder watcher triggers Dataflow for processing.
4. Dataflow writes processed data to BigQuery.
5. A Cloud Function sends an email via SendGrid after processing is complete.
