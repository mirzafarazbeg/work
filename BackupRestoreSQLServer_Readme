1. Database Backup on Production Server:
   - The process starts with the SQL Server on the Production Server.
   - A database backup is created and saved locally or in a predefined location on the server.

2. Move Backup to Cloud Storage:
   - The backup file is transferred to Cloud Storage (e.g., Google Cloud Platform) for secure off-site storage using CLI or other tools.
   - This step ensures that the backup is protected and accessible for restoration or other use cases.

3. Download Backup from Cloud Storage:
   - The backup file is downloaded from the cloud storage onto a Backup Server.
   - This step is typically done to restore the database in a different environment or for disaster recovery purposes.

4. Restore on Backup Server:
   - Finally, the backup file is restored on the SQL Server running on the Backup Server.
   - This completes the backup and restore operation.


Key Points:
- The Production Server is the source where the live database resides and backups originate.
- Cloud Storage serves as a middle layer for secure backup storage and transfer between servers.
- The Backup Server is the destination where the backup is restored, often used for testing or redundancy purposes.

This process ensures data availability, security, and resilience by maintaining backups across different systems.
